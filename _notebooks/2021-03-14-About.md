# What is this all about?
Hmm, I initially started this blog because I was studying machine learning and was somewhat fascinated by the ability to do literate programming using jupyter notebooks. A concept I had only ever really encountered in emacs' org mode. After seeing how well jupyter notebooks worked, I wanted to share my journey in ML with friends, aggregate resources to one spot, and teach people stuff eventually...butttttt then I needed a job and that dream more or less died. 

Instead of studying machine learning, I mostly have been studying things that I think could land me a job sometime this year. 

# So what now?
Well, instead of just posting about ML, why not post about anything? I learn cool shit every day and am just now starting my web development journey, so why not share that? I'm sure I'll appreciate documenting my thought process someday and perhaps others will find it interesting or educational.

Gonna keep this one short and just post again soon. 

Thank you all for reading.
