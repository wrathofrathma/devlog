Greetings all, I'm Rathma. 

I'm just another programming and manga addict. Right now I'm flirting with machine learning and hope to someday do research in the field.

I've been doing this programming thing for about 10-11 years now...so I guess it's about time I start sharing some of it. 

Maybe someday if I'm feeling cute I'll update this and the index into a real page.
