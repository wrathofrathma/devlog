Greetings all, I'm Rathma. 

I'm just a guy who chases after a variety of ~~~addictions~~~ passions. Often times that has been programming over the last 10-11 years because I just have a genuine passion for learning new things and this field is constantly evolving. I discovered some time ago that I also really enjoy teaching, and someday I hope to become a professor that inspires a passion similar to mine in any field. Until then, I'm just going to share my journey learning a variety of topics here and hopefully somebody finds it interesting or useful.

Maybe someday if I'm feeling cute I'll update this and the index into a real page.
